# Toothsome Tomato
**A pomodoro app that feels good to use**

This is a small desktop app that I made in 2021 because I wanted to experiment with UI design. The app uses electron.js and web technologies under the hood and does everything a pomodoro app has to do: you can set focus periods and receive notifications when it's time for a break.

# Demo:

# Installation:
For **Windows**, you can download the installer from `toothsome-tomato/installer`, or by clicking at the link below:
##### [Download for Windows](https://github.com/albiDmtr/toothsome-tomato/raw/main/installer/Toothsome%20Tomato%20Setup%200.1.0.exe "##### Download for Windows")

If you're using **Mac or Linux**, you need to build the app from the source code. To do that, clone this repository and use a tool like `electron-builder` or `electron-packager`.
